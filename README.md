Simple and slow visualization of a grid of 4d cubes (tesseracts https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract) written in Python (jupyter notebook). Proof of concept.

Inspired by http://hi.gher.space/classic/page8.htm and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yW--eQaA2I&t=24s

The ultimate vision for the project is to rewrite it to Java/C# on top of a shader language and make it a playable blocksworld.
